Fallbot
=======

My IRC Chat bot, primarily designed for twitch, but will eventually be usable for other IRC services.
It is written in java, and based on Pircbotx which is under the GPLv3 license, and uses a few apache libraries, mostly Pircbotx dependencies. As of right now, this bot is pretty non-functional, but it is my intention is to make it very configurable.
