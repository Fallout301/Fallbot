Fallbot
=======

My IRC Chat bot, primarily designed for twitch, but will eventually be usable for other IRC services.
It is written in java, and based on Pircbot which is under the GPLv3 license. I am aware that PircBot is rather outdated, but I believe it to still be a good base. As of right now, this bot is pretty non-functional, but it is my intention is to make it very configurable.




Required Libraries are

mariadb-java-client-1.1.7
pircbot 1.5.0
